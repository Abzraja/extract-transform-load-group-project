## Project Proposal:

### Project Outline
One might argue that people are momentarily happier when drinking alcohol -- but that over more extended periods, drinking more does not make them more satisfied with life. As such, the industry we have focused on is healthcare. 

This project is an attempt to extract, transform and load a final dataset that can address questions behind how the use of alcohol impacts the happiness of nations around the globe.


### Data Sources
We needed 2 data sets:

1. [Alcohol Consumption Data](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/total-(recorded-unrecorded)-alcohol-per-capita-(15-)-consumption) -
(ref: World Health Organisation - Alcohol, total per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol) (SDG Indicator 3.5.2))

2. [World Happiness Report]() - (ref: Kaggle.com - World Happiness Report up to 2020)
